# Kyuubi K8s Operator

The Kyuubi K8s Operator is a Kubernetes charm for Apache Kyuubi, a distributed and multi-tenant gateway to provide serverless SQL on Data Warehouses and Lakehouses. It is part of an open source, end-to-end, production ready data platform on top of cloud native technologies provided by Canonical.

This operator charm deploys and operates Apache Kyuubi in Kubernetes environment and provides users with a JDBC compliant endpoint which can be used by JDBC compliant tools and analytics platforms to execute SQL queries on the Charmed Spark cluster.

The Kyuubi charm can be found on [Charmhub](https://charmhub.io/kyuubi-k8s). 

Apache Kyuubi is a free, open source software project by the Apache Software Foundation. Users can find out more at the [Kyuubi project page](https://kyuubi.apache.org/).
